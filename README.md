# Overview

- This repository will be my following along this video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgYiyoyNPrv_yNp5Pzsx0A3gQ8-tfg66j).
    - It has been a while since I have used Ruby and RoR 5 to build a project independently so I will be following this video
    and then I will implement a full-stack web app myself using Ruby, RoR 5, and React.
    
- I will be creating branches for each individual video. The initial master branch will have the changes up to the end of video 1
which is just configuring our application to use HTTP cookies and to whitelist domains.

- The repository with the corresponding front-end code is [here](https://github.com/ttran9/ror-api-authentication-tutorial-frontend).
